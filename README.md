# ChatBot Front-end using Python Streamlit

**About**

In my current role at CrowdDoing, I'm developing a front-end for a chatbot using Python. I have compiled a simple project based on my learnings from this work.

**Project Description**

Chatbots are becoming essential for websites and applications, enhancing user engagement and automating customer service. In this project, I have created a simple chatbot front-end using Python and Streamlit. Streamlit is a powerful tool for creating interactive web applications with minimal effort. Additionally, I have utilized the "Streamlit Pills" library to create prompt suggestions for users interacting with the bot.
